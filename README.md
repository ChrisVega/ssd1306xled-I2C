# ssd1306xled-I2C


A modified version of [Defragster's AVR port](https://github.com/Defragster/ssd1306xled) use TinywireM for i2c transmission. The original version was incompatable with other devices that used TinywireM, this provides a nice alternative which is still more light weight that other libraries.
